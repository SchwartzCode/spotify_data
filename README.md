# Mucking about with my spotify data

To use the code, put the .json files Spotify sends you in a folder called "data" in the root of this repository (i.e. the directory this README is in).

To install dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You might need to delete some special characters from the imported JSON files. VScode's `vscode-position` extension is very helpful with this.
